# this docker compose file will runn each Dockerfile from each service on a diffrerent container and port
# to run this file use the command: docker-compose up -d --build, the --build flag tells docker to rebuild Docker image based on the "build" property path down below.The -d tag avoids your
    #terminal from beeing blocked after the docker containers start running.
# to stop the containers use: docker-compose down
# to delete the images use: docker rmi -f $(docker images -a -q)
